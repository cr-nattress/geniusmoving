# User Experience (UX) Research

This folder contains user experience research, design resources, and usability studies for the GeniusMoving project.

## Purpose

The UX research folder serves as a centralized location for:

- User personas and journey maps
- Wireframes and prototypes
- Usability test results and feedback
- Design system documentation
- UI component specifications
- Accessibility guidelines and compliance documentation
- User research findings

## Methodology

Our UX research employs various methodologies to ensure a user-centered design approach:

1. **User Interviews**: Qualitative research with potential and existing customers to understand their needs, pain points, and expectations
2. **Usability Testing**: Observing users as they interact with the GeniusMoving interface to identify usability issues
3. **A/B Testing**: Comparing different design solutions to determine which performs better with real users
4. **Heuristic Evaluation**: Expert review of the interface against established usability principles
5. **Analytics Review**: Analysis of user behavior data to identify patterns and improvement opportunities

## Design Principles

The GeniusMoving interface adheres to the following design principles:

- **Simplicity**: Clear, straightforward user flows that minimize cognitive load
- **Consistency**: Uniform design patterns and interaction models throughout the application
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with WCAG guidelines to ensure usability for all users
- **Responsiveness**: Optimal experience across all device types and screen sizes
- **Feedback**: Clear system status indicators and user action confirmations

## Integration with Development

UX research and design artifacts should be referenced during:

- Feature planning and prioritization
- Frontend implementation
- Quality assurance testing
- Product refinement discussions

## Contributing

When adding new UX research or design artifacts to this folder:

1. Organize files in appropriate subfolders by research type or design phase
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Include dates in research documents (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
4. Provide context and methodology information for research findings
5. Update this README when adding significant new resources
