Page Analysis
HTML Structure (DOM)
Login Page: The login page is structured as a centered form interface containing the SmartMoving branding, a welcome message, input fields, and supplemental links. At the top of the page, the SmartMoving logo/name is displayed (likely as an image with alt text "SmartMoving"), accompanied by a tagline “Simplify the way your team works.”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. Beneath this, a heading or greeting text “Welcome Back!” is shown​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
 to reorient returning users. The form itself is encapsulated in a container (e.g. a <div> with a class like .login-container or similar) to center it on the page. Inside the form (<form> tag), the DOM includes:
An email address field – an <input type="email"> for the user’s email. This field is likely paired with a <label> element reading “Email Address”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
 for accessibility and clarity. The label may be visually positioned above the input or as a placeholder inside it.
A password field – an <input type="password"> for the user’s password, with a corresponding <label> “Password”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
.
A “Forgot Password?” link – an anchor (<a>) element labeled “Forgot Password?” positioned near the password field​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. In many designs, this link is placed to the right of or below the password input. It likely navigates to the forgot-password page (/forgot-password).
A “Remember me” checkbox – an <input type="checkbox"> with an associated <label> “Remember me”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. This lets users stay logged in. The checkbox and label are probably wrapped in a container (e.g. a <div class="remember-me">) and placed on the form alongside the forgot-password link. A common pattern is to use a flex container or a small <div> grouping the checkbox and link, so that the “Remember me” text is on the left and the “Forgot Password?” link is on the right of that section.
A Sign In button – a <button type="submit"> for form submission, labeled “Sign In”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. This is typically a prominently styled button (e.g. primary color background) that submits the login credentials.
Following the form, the login page includes a small footer note or additional links for new or curious users. For example, it shows: “Want to learn more? Request a Demo · Contact Us · FAQ.”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. This suggests a footer section (perhaps a <div class="login-footer">) containing informational links to the public site: Request a Demo, Contact Us, and FAQ. These are likely simple anchor links separated by middot (·) or vertical bars. They provide navigation for users who might not have an account or need assistance. The overall HTML likely uses semantic containers such as a main wrapper (possibly a <main> or just a centered <section>) to contain the login form card. The structure is clean and minimal – mostly standard form elements within a centered container – which is typical for login screens. Forgot Password Page: The forgot-password page has a very similar DOM structure and layout, reusing much of the login page’s styling. At the top, it likely also displays the SmartMoving logo/name and tagline for consistency (e.g. the same header area with “SmartMoving” and “Simplify the way your team works.”). Instead of “Welcome Back,” it presents a title like “Reset Password”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
 to indicate the purpose of the page. The content area includes instructions and a single field form:
An instructional text such as “Enter your email address below and we’ll send you a link to reset your password.”​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. This could be a paragraph or small <p> tag providing context to the user.
A password reset form – likely a <form> containing one labeled field for the email address. The field is an <input type="email"> for the user’s account email, possibly with placeholder text “Email Address” and a corresponding visible <label> for accessibility.
A submit button – a <button> to submit the form, possibly labeled “Send Reset Link” (as indicated in the support docs​
HELP.SMARTMOVING.COM
) or simply “Reset Password.” This triggers the password reset process.
It’s common for the forgot-password form to also include a “Back to Login” link, allowing users to return to the login page. The support article suggests after submitting, users can “select Back to login to be brought to the log in screen”​
HELP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. This implies the forgot-password page likely provides a navigation option (perhaps a link under the form or on the success message) to go back to the login screen. Both pages use standard semantic HTML5 elements for forms (labels, inputs, buttons) to ensure accessibility and proper structure. The DOM is likely devoid of extraneous elements – focusing on a simple, columnar form layout. Overall, the HTML structure is straightforward: a container with a heading and maybe logo, followed by the form (with its fields and actions), and some footer/help links.
CSS Styles and Layout
Layout and Positioning: The SmartMoving login and reset pages employ a modern, responsive design. Key layout containers likely use Flexbox for alignment. For instance, the outer container wrapping the form may be set to display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; to center the login form on the screen (both horizontally and vertically). This is a common strategy to make the login panel appear centered on larger screens. Alternatively, a combination of a fixed max-width on the form (to prevent it from stretching too wide) and auto margins could be used to center it. The form itself might be styled as a card with a subtle drop-shadow or border, distinguishing it from the page background. Within the form, flexbox or similar techniques are used for the small horizontal layout elements. For example, the “Remember me” checkbox and the “Forgot Password?” link are likely arranged in a single row container with justify-content: space-between so that the checkbox aligns to the left and the link to the right. This keeps the form neat and all elements visible without breaking onto multiple lines on wider screens. On narrower screens (mobile devices), the CSS is probably configured to stack these elements. The form’s CSS could use a media query to change the layout: for example, on mobile, the “Forgot Password?” link might drop below the checkbox (or the two might center-align one above the other) to ensure usability in a small width. Styling and Theme: The pages likely follow SmartMoving’s branding guidelines, using the company’s color scheme and clean design aesthetic. The background of the page might be a solid neutral color (for instance, a white or light gray form on a colored background, or vice versa). The primary button (“Sign In” or “Send Reset Link”) is probably styled with the brand’s accent color to stand out. (SmartMoving’s marketing materials suggest a blue or green theme, but without direct CSS we deduce it’s a noticeable contrasting color). The button would have CSS classes (e.g. .btn.btn-primary) or custom classes that apply background-color, text color, padding, border-radius, etc., giving it a modern look (likely rounded corners and a hover effect). The “Remember me” checkbox might use a custom styled checkbox (possibly with a custom checkbox indicator or a default browser style with just a small box). Class naming conventions in the CSS are not explicitly known without the source, but we can infer they use descriptive classes for major elements: e.g., .login-container, .login-form, .form-field, .btn-primary, etc. The styling strategy could be BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming or simply semantic class names, depending on the front-end framework. Given that the application is built in Angular, the CSS might be component-scoped (each component like login might have its own SCSS), so class names could be prefixed or scoped by Angular’s rendering (Angular adds unique attribute selectors to scope styles, e.g., _ngcontent attributes). The output HTML, however, would still contain the class names for styling hooks. Responsive Techniques: Both pages are mobile-responsive. Using CSS media queries, the layout adjusts for smaller screens. Likely adjustments include: making the container full-width (with small padding) on mobile, enlarging touch targets (buttons and inputs) to be easily tap-able, and possibly hiding non-critical decorative text. For example, the “Want to learn more? Request a Demo · Contact Us · FAQ” footer might be hidden or abbreviated on a tiny screen to reduce clutter. The font sizes might also shift slightly via CSS (e.g., larger text for the “Welcome Back!” on desktop, but slightly smaller on mobile to fit). Overall, the CSS ensures that the form and its elements do not overflow on small screens and remain user-friendly. Animations: The pages appear to be mostly static in content, but there could be subtle CSS animations or transitions for a polished feel. For instance, the focus state of input fields might have a smooth transition (changing border color or box-shadow on focus with 0.2s ease). If any error messages appear, they might fade in/out. There could also be a slight fade-in animation when the page loads or when switching to the forgot-password form (if this is a single-page app route change, Angular might animate the route). However, there’s no obvious heavy animation. Any animations present are likely lightweight and CSS-based (e.g., using transition on hover states for buttons, or a keyframes fade-in for form appearance). In summary, the CSS is geared towards a clean, professional look: a centered form layout achieved with flexbox, brand-consistent colors and fonts, responsive adjustments for different devices, and perhaps minimal animations to enhance UX (like smooth hover and focus effects). The use of modern CSS (Flexbox, possibly CSS Grid for overall page structure, and media queries) ensures the pages are both visually appealing and functional across browsers and devices.
Fonts and Typography
SmartMoving’s login and reset pages use a clean sans-serif font for all text, aligning with modern SaaS design trends. The exact font family appears to be a custom choice likely consistent with their branding. It’s common for web apps to use either a standard web-safe font or include a web font for a distinctive look. On these pages, headings like “Welcome Back!” and “Reset Password” might be slightly larger and possibly use a heavier weight to stand out. Body text (labels, input placeholders, footnotes) are in a regular weight. The tagline “Simplify the way your team works.” is probably styled in a lighter weight or italic to set it off as a slogan at the top. There is no direct evidence of the specific font family from the snippet alone, but there are a few possibilities:
System Sans-Serif: They might be using system fonts (like Helvetica/Arial on Mac/Windows) for simplicity and performance.
Google Fonts or Custom Web Font: Many Angular applications import Google Fonts. If SmartMoving used Angular Material design, they might have included Roboto, as Angular Material’s default typography uses Roboto. Roboto is a common sans-serif that would give a similar clean look. If not Material, they may have chosen another font like Open Sans, Lato, or Source Sans Pro, etc. Another clue is the marketing site; if the marketing site uses a particular font, the app likely uses it too for consistency. (The marketing site might use custom fonts, but given no obvious link to Google Fonts in its HTML, they could be self-hosting a font or using a standard one.)
The font sizes on the login form are tuned for readability: likely around 14px–16px for input text and labels (to be legible without zooming). Headings like “Welcome Back!” might be ~24px or larger. The Remember me and Forgot Password? text would be standard small text (perhaps 14px) since they are minor elements. The color of the text is probably a dark gray or near-black on a light background for good contrast, ensuring accessibility. Font Loading: If a custom or Google font is used, it would be loaded in the <head> of the page via a <link> to a stylesheet (e.g., Google Fonts CSS) or via a @font-face in the CSS bundle. There is no visible flash of unstyled text in the application (as it’s a relatively simple page), so the font likely loads quickly. We did not find an explicit reference to Google Fonts in the snippet of the marketing site (no fonts.googleapis.com reference was present), which could mean SmartMoving either uses system fonts or self-hosts their font files. It’s also possible that the SmartMoving logo itself uses a particular font style that is echoed in the site text. In summary, typography on these pages is modern and straightforward: a sans-serif font with a few variations in weight for headers vs. body text. The emphasis is on clarity and readability, important for forms. All text (labels, placeholders, button text) uses sentence case (as seen with “Email Address” and “Password” capitalizing each word) which is a typical style choice for form labels​
APP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. The consistent typography helps maintain a professional look across the login and forgot-password screens.
UI Frameworks or Libraries
The SmartMoving app appears to be built on a custom UI framework rather than an off-the-shelf theme like Bootstrap or Tailwind. There are a few indicators for this:
The HTML snippet and style of the pages (simple form, custom layout) does not show telltale signs of Bootstrap (e.g., class names like .container, .row, .col-, or .form-control are not apparent in the snippet). It’s likely not using Bootstrap for the login page, as the structure and wording (“Sign In” rather than a typical Bootstrap button text class) suggests a custom implementation.
There’s no obvious sign of Tailwind CSS utility classes either (which are very distinct, like class="mt-4 text-center" etc., none of which appear in the captured text).
The design could be using Angular Material components for the form. Angular Material is a library that provides UI components styled according to Google’s Material Design. If they used Material for the input fields and button, the DOM would include elements like <mat-form-field> or classes such as .mat-input-element, etc. The snippet we have doesn’t show those (it shows the plain text of labels and such), so it’s inconclusive. They might be using Material under the hood, or they may have built the form with basic HTML inputs. If Material was used, the visual style would include floating labels and rippling buttons. Absent direct evidence, it seems they opted for a simpler custom UI for these pages.
Another possibility is a smaller CSS framework or custom component library. Given the Angular context, some teams use libraries like PrimeNG or NG Bootstrap, but the login page’s simplicity suggests it may not need those. It might just be handcrafted CSS for this specific page.
In summary, no major third-party CSS framework is obvious on the login/forgot password pages; the UI is likely built with custom styles or a light-weight component library. This gives them full control over the look and feel, which is tailored to their brand. One UI library that is clearly in play is the Angular framework itself (more on that below in JavaScript Libraries). Angular may impose some structure on the components (e.g., if using Angular’s form controls, there might be Angular-specific attributes in the DOM), but that doesn’t manifest as an external CSS framework per se. It’s also worth noting the presence of certain UI elements like the checkbox and button might use browser default styling or minimal enhancements. If Angular Material or similar was used, the checkbox would have a custom appearance (like a filled checkbox with the accent color). If custom, they may have styled the checkbox via CSS (possibly hiding the default box and using a span for a custom checkbox indicator). Icons and Images: The pages are fairly minimal, but any icons (for example, maybe an icon in the “Email” field or a lock icon for password) would hint at a library. There’s no indication of icon libraries like FontAwesome in the snippet. It’s likely they did not use extra icon fonts on the login screen, aside from the logo image. If needed, they might use an SVG for the logo. Overall, the login and forgot password pages seem to be built with a bespoke UI styling (possibly influenced by Angular Material design principles, but not necessarily using the library outright). This means recreating these pages in Windsurf with Cascade would involve writing custom HTML/CSS to match their appearance, rather than relying on a pre-made template from a framework.
JavaScript Libraries and Front-End Functionality
SmartMoving’s front-end is powered by Angular, a robust client-side framework. In fact, the development team’s profiles indicate the use of Angular (with TypeScript) for the web application​
LINKEDIN.COM
. Angular is a comprehensive framework, which means the login and forgot password pages are likely components within an Angular single-page application (SPA). When a user navigates to app.smartmoving.com/login, the Angular app loads and presents the login component. Being an Angular app, the pages would utilize Angular’s built-in capabilities:
Angular Forms: The login form is probably implemented as an Angular reactive form or template-driven form. This provides client-side validation (for example, marking the email and password fields as required, checking email format validity via Angular’s Validators). The presence of Angular means that as soon as the user tries to submit, the framework can intercept the event and validate inputs before sending to the server.
Client-side Validation: Likely the app uses Angular’s form validation to ensure the email is properly formatted and the fields aren’t empty. For instance, if you click “Sign In” with blank fields, Angular might set form errors and perhaps the UI will display an error message or highlight the empty fields in red. Similarly, on the forgot password form, if you submit without an email or with an improperly formatted email, the form might show a small validation error (e.g., “Please enter a valid email address”). These behaviors come from Angular’s forms module rather than a separate library.
No jQuery required: Because Angular handles DOM manipulation and events, it’s very unlikely that jQuery is used. The app would not need jQuery for such simple interactions. Angular itself provides the needed functionality for showing/hiding error messages, etc.
Other JavaScript libraries that might be present:
Angular Material or other UI components: If they used Angular Material as mentioned, the JS part of Angular Material would be in play (for example, to handle the checkbox animations or input focusing). But again, not confirmed.
Animation libraries: Angular has its own animation package (using CSS or Web Animations API). They might have used Angular’s animations for any route transition (maybe a fade when switching to forgot password page). It’s unlikely they pulled in something like GSAP for such a simple page; any animation would be handled by Angular’s native capabilities or CSS.
Client-side form validation library: Not needed because Angular covers it. We see no sign of something like Parsley.js or jQuery Validate – those are typically used in non-framework sites. Here Angular does the heavy lifting.
Others: The login page might include logic for remembering the user (setting a cookie or using localStorage if “Remember me” is checked). Angular can handle that directly or call a small helper library. Often, “Remember me” simply sets a persistent cookie via the server on successful login or uses a token with a longer expiration – the implementation is likely in the back-end, not via a separate JS library.
Because this is an SPA, upon successful login, Angular will likely route the user to the main app interface (without a full page reload). The initial loading of the login page likely involves loading Angular bundles (such as runtime.js, polyfills.js, main.js, etc. typical of a production Angular app). These scripts are minified and handle rendering the components. We also know the application is hosted on Azure and uses .NET Core, so it might serve the Angular app statically and use API calls for authentication. In summary, Angular is the primary front-end framework 
LINKEDIN.COM
. It provides the structure and any needed client-side functionality. No additional front-end libraries are obvious on these pages; the functionality (showing the form, toggling “remember me”, navigating to forgot password, form validation) is either basic enough to not need extra libraries or is handled by Angular’s ecosystem. This keeps the tech stack streamlined on the front-end: essentially Angular + perhaps Angular Material (or purely custom components) for UI, and standard Angular modules for forms and routing.
Back-End Technologies
SmartMoving’s platform is backed by a .NET (C#) environment, likely ASP.NET Core running on Azure. Clues such as the app’s deployment to an Azure Web App (smartmoving-qa1-webapp.azurewebsites.net) and HTTP headers indicating “X-Powered-By: ASP.NET” confirm a Microsoft stack on the server side​
HYBRID-ANALYSIS.COM
. In practice, this means the login and forgot password endpoints (/login and /forgot-password) are handled by an ASP.NET Core application which serves the Angular front-end and provides APIs for authentication. Here’s how the back-end likely ties in:
When the Angular app makes a login attempt, it probably sends a request to a REST API endpoint (for example, a POST request to /api/auth/login or similar) with the user’s email and password. The server (ASP.NET Core) verifies the credentials (possibly checking against a database) and returns a token or session cookie.
If “Remember me” was checked, the server might issue a longer-lasting authentication token or cookie (for instance, a JWT with a longer expiration, or an auth-cookie with a persistent flag). ASP.NET Identity (the authentication library in .NET) supports a “remember me” that sets a persistent cookie.
The presence of Azure indicates they might be using Azure services (like Azure SQL for the database, Azure Active Directory B2C for identity, or simply Azure App Service for hosting). The mention of ARRAffinity cookie in context suggests the site is an Azure App Service; ARRAffinity is used by Azure for session stickiness.
The forgot-password process likely triggers a backend routine: when the user submits their email, an Angular HTTP request goes to something like /api/auth/forgot-password carrying the email. The .NET back-end then generates a secure reset token and sends an email to the user with a reset link. This is all handled server-side (possibly using an email service integrated with their system). The Angular front-end will show a success message if the back-end responds indicating the email was sent.
We should note that because it’s a single-page application, the routing for /login and /forgot-password is likely handled client-side by Angular’s Router. The ASP.NET backend probably serves the same index.html for any unknown route (so that the Angular app can load and then display the appropriate page). Thus, /login isn’t an ASP.NET MVC view in the traditional sense, but rather an Angular route. However, there could be a server-side redirect such that if you hit the root URL and you’re not authenticated, it serves the login page. The technology stack can be summarized as ASP.NET Core (C#) on the server, with an Angular front-end​
LINKEDIN.COM
. The deployment on Azure suggests they use cloud services for reliability and scaling. The database could be a cloud database (like Azure SQL or Cosmos DB), though that’s beyond the scope of the page analysis. One interesting aspect is that these pages are part of the authentication module. Often, frameworks like .NET Core might serve these via a combination of front-end and back-end. It’s possible the login is fully API-driven (likely, given SPA), or they could have a fallback server-rendered form for older browsers. But since the content (Welcome Back!, etc.) was indexed, the Angular app likely does server-side rendering or simply allows search engines to see the static content. Possibly, Angular Universal (server-side rendering) could be used to pre-render the login page for faster first paint and SEO. If they did, the HTML delivered to the browser would contain the form and text (which is why search engines could crawl “Email Address. Password…” text). This would be an advanced implementation where Angular on the server (Node.js or .NET’s Angular SSR) generates the HTML for the login route, improving performance. In terms of platform, the presence of .NET suggests they might use the ASP.NET Identity library for handling user accounts, password hashes, etc., and perhaps Entity Framework Core for database interactions, though those details are internal. To recreate these pages in Windsurf/Cascade, one doesn’t need to replicate the back-end, but it’s useful to know that the original relies on a JSON API. In Cascade, these pages would be static or use Cascade’s form handling if needed, but the visual and functional mimicry would focus only on front-end behavior.
Form Functionality and Behavior
Both the login and forgot-password forms are designed with usability and security in mind. Here’s a breakdown of their functionality and interactive behavior: Login Form Behavior:
Input Validation (Client-Side): The email and password fields are very likely marked as required. The email field uses type="email", which provides basic HTML5 email format validation. Angular’s form logic further ensures that an email address looks like an email (contains “@”, etc.). If a user tries to submit the form with an empty email or password, the form will not immediately fire an API call; instead, it will display a validation hint. Commonly, a message like “Email is required” or a red outline on the empty field would appear. Similarly, if the email format is wrong (e.g., missing “@”), the field might show “Please enter a valid email.” This reduces round trips to the server for obvious errors.
Input Validation (Server-Side): Upon submission with filled fields, the back-end also validates credentials. If the email/password combo is incorrect, the server will return an error (such as HTTP 401 Unauthorized or a message). The front-end will likely show an error message near the top of the form or inline with the fields like “Invalid login credentials. Please try again.” The page might shake or just display the message in red. This error-handling ensures the user knows the login failed. (The exact text isn’t in the snippet, but this is standard behavior.)
“Remember Me” Functionality: When the user checks “Remember me,” a longer-lived session is created. This is handled mostly by back-end/auth cookies, but from the front-end perspective, the checkbox’s state might be passed along with the login request (e.g., a boolean in the JSON payload). There’s no special dynamic behavior on the form itself when checking this box, aside from it being a typical checkbox (possibly it could toggle some explanation like “Do not use on a public computer” if they chose to implement that, but none indicated).
Submit Action: Hitting the “Sign In” button or pressing Enter while focused on a field will trigger the form submission. Because it’s an Angular app, the form submission is handled by Angular’s (ngSubmit) event, which calls a login function. This function likely disables the form and shows a loading spinner or changes the button to a loading state while waiting for server response (this kind of UX enhancement is common to prevent multiple clicks; though not confirmed, it’s a good practice).
Transitions after Login: On successful login, the application will route the user away from the login page to the main dashboard of SmartMoving. This transition is seamless (the URL might change from /login to /dashboard for example, without a full page reload). During this, the Angular app might display a brief loading indicator or simply show the new view. There’s no explicit “success” message on the login page itself – it just goes on to the next page of the app.
Forgot Password Form Behavior:
Validation: The forgot password form also requires a valid email. The single input is type="email" and likely has required. If you click the “Send Reset Link” button with no email, the page will prompt for the email (perhaps highlighting the field or showing “Please enter your email address”). If an improperly formatted email is entered, it similarly will prompt correction. This uses the same Angular form validation mechanisms as the login form.
Submitting Reset Request: When a properly formatted email is submitted, the front-end calls the appropriate API (e.g., POST /api/auth/forgot-password with the email). There may be a slight delay as the app communicates with the server. During this time, the UI could show a spinner or disable the button to indicate processing.
Feedback Messages: After submission, one of two things typically happens:
If the email is recognized and a reset email is sent, the page might show a confirmation message along the lines of “We’ve sent a password reset link to your email. Please check your inbox.” This could either replace the form or appear above it. In some designs, the form is replaced entirely by a confirmation state.
If the email is not found (i.e., the user entered an address that isn’t in the system), the system might still respond with a generic success message (for security, many systems don’t openly say “email not found” to avoid revealing user data). It might simply always indicate an email was sent, even if it wasn’t, to the user. Or it could show an error like “No account exists for that email.” The exact behavior isn’t known, but security best-practice leans toward a generic success message to avoid enumerating emails.
According to the support article, after the reset link is sent, users are instructed to “follow the link provided to reset your password” in their email and then “select Back to login to be brought to the login screen”​
HELP.SMARTMOVING.COM
. This implies the forgot-password page, after submission, likely provides a “Back to Login” button or link along with the confirmation message. This lets the user navigate easily back to the login page (especially useful if they realize they remembered their password or if they want to try again).
Accessibility Considerations: The form elements are likely optimized for accessibility:
Each input has a corresponding <label> which is either explicitly linked via for attribute or implicitly wrapped. This helps screen readers announce the field labels (“Email Address, edit text” for example).
The tabindex order is logical (it follows the DOM order: email, password, remember me, then Sign In).
Hitting "Tab" will move through inputs and the checkbox, and focusing on the checkbox then hitting space can toggle it – standard behavior preserved by using a real <input type="checkbox"> and label.
The “Forgot Password?” link is keyboard accessible and presumably properly labeled (it’s descriptive by itself).
Color contrast for text is likely sufficient (dark text on light background, and the button text on its colored background should have enough contrast).
If Angular added any ARIA attributes (for example, Angular Material would add aria-label or such on icons), those would aid accessibility as well. In a simple custom form, they might not need extra ARIA, since using semantic <form>, <label>, <input> is already accessible.
Security: Although not directly visible in the UI, the forms have important security aspects:
Password inputs use type="password" which masks the characters.
The application likely enforces TLS (HTTPS) – indeed app.smartmoving.com is loaded over HTTPS – to encrypt the credentials in transit.
The “Forgot Password” mechanism is implemented such that the actual reset happens via a secure token emailed to the user, ensuring no password is reset directly through the form without email verification.
Error Handling: In case of network issues or server errors, the app should handle them gracefully. For instance, if the server is down or takes too long, the front-end might display a generic “Unable to connect. Please try again later.” message. Angular’s HTTP client would catch errors like a 500 response and could show a notification. These pages likely have minimal error states aside from incorrect credentials or unknown email, but the framework is capable of showing feedback. To replicate these in Windsurf/Cascade, one would implement similar behaviors: use HTML5 input types and required attributes for basic validation, add client-side scripts (maybe using Cascade’s capabilities or custom JS) for additional validation if needed, and ensure the form actions mimic the described process (though actual email sending might not be needed in a static mock). Ensuring the form is accessible and provides user-friendly messages (like the SmartMoving pages do) would be key. Summary: The login and forgot-password forms work together to provide a smooth user experience – guiding the user to enter correct information, handling mistakes with clear messages, and implementing the necessary steps (authentication or sending reset emails) with appropriate feedback. This reflects a mature application design prioritizing both usability and security. All these behaviors align with standard patterns for login systems, which SmartMoving adheres to in their implementation​
