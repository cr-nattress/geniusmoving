Real-Time Scheduling & Paperless Dispatch: Schedulers can assign crews to jobs in real time and make adjustments on the fly​

4. SmartMoving Software
What it is: SmartMoving is an out-of-the-box moving CRM and management system that consolidates everything needed to run a moving company in one place​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. It focuses on helping moving businesses increase efficiency and revenue through better organization and automation. Who it’s for: Designed for moving companies of all sizes but especially appealing to small and mid-sized movers that want a ready-to-use solution with strong CRM capabilities.

CRM and Dashboard: SmartMoving offers robust CRM features. When you log in, the home screen dashboard shows KPIs like revenue by salesperson, lead sources, booking rates, etc., helping you monitor performance at a glance​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. You can easily create tasks and follow-ups for each lead, ensuring systematic sales practices.
Booking & Dispatch Simplified: The software streamlines the booking process – customers can be scheduled with real-time availability and pricing, and jobs are dispatched to crews efficiently​
MOVERSDEV.COM
. A dispatch board helps assign crews, trucks, and equipment, optimizing routes and schedules for local moves. (SmartMoving also supports basic storage management and recurring billing for storage clients.)
Crew Management & Mobile App: There’s a crew mobile app which allows foremen to access job details and capture digital signatures and payments on-site. Crew management features let you track labor hours and performance. However, some users find the crew app workflow a bit clunky (e.g. needing to pull up multiple forms for signatures)​
SUPERMOVE.COM
.
Reporting & Analytics: SmartMoving includes a variety of reports (e.g. sales conversion, marketing channel ROI, job cost analysis). While early versions had limited reporting range, the platform has been continuously improving its analytics based on customer feedback.

MOVERSDEV.COM
. By integrating the whole workflow from initial inquiry to invoicing (including payroll integration), it cuts down on duplicate data entry and manual handoffs between systems​
MOVERSDEV.COM
. Its focus on CRM means you can easily track leads and follow-ups, which helps increase bookings and revenue. One thing to note is that because SmartMoving is “out-of-the-box,” it has limited customization – you get a defined set of workflows. This is great for simplicity, but if your business needs very specific processes or tariff calculations for long-distance moves, you might find those features less flexible​
SUPERMOVE.COM
​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Overall, it solves everyday efficiency problems for small movers by providing a proven blueprint to run a moving company, with the trade-off of less tailoring to edge cases.
5. MoveitPro
What it is: MoveitPro is a web-based move management software and CRM that unifies sales, operations, and fleet management for moving companies​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. It’s one of the older established cloud solutions in the moving industry, known for offering a wide range of features on a single platform. Who it’s for: Suitable for small to large moving companies that want an all-in-one system. Many small residential movers use MoveitPro for its comprehensive features, though it’s especially beneficial if you want integrated fleet and payroll tools in addition to CRM. Pricing is typically based on the size of your company (starts around $150/month)​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. Key Features:
Scheduling & Dispatch: A central calendar allows you to schedule jobs and assign crews/trucks. MoveitPro’s dispatch board helps coordinate multiple moves, and it supports multi-day jobs and split crews. (However, some users note that certain scheduling tasks – like adjusting a booked move – can be cumbersome, as editing a booking might “unbook” it temporarily​
SUPERMOVE.COM
.)
Inventory & Estimating: The platform includes an inventory management system where you can build moving estimates by selecting items (with predefined weights or time estimates per item). It auto-calculates time/cost based on inventory and services, standardizing the estimating process​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Movers can also use tablets for in-home estimates and capture customer signatures.
Digital Paperwork & Invoicing: MoveitPro makes your operation mostly paperless – you can generate and email all documents (estimates, contracts, BOLs) and collect payments on-site via the app​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. It also tracks expenses, does payroll calculations, and can handle recurring billing (for storage or repeat customers).
Customer Portal: There’s an online portal where customers can log in to view and update their move details. They can see estimates, pay deposits, and even make minor edits to their inventory if needed​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. This enhances customer experience and reduces phone calls to your office.
Support & Integrations: MoveitPro has a dedicated support team – you can reach them via phone or live chat and it’s known for responsive support​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. It integrates with QuickBooks and has an open API for other integrations. The company regularly adds features, though the system tends to be rigid in how those features work (less customizable).
Problems it solves: MoveitPro is essentially a one-stop shop that can replace multiple tools (scheduling whiteboards, accounting software, paper files) with one system. For a small moving company, this means better coordination: salespeople, dispatchers, and crew all see the same information, which reduces miscommunication. It particularly shines in helping eliminate paperwork – crews can get digital work orders and capture signatures and payments without bringing forms back to the office​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. This speeds up billing and cash flow. Another big benefit is its fleet management extras (tracking truck maintenance, fuel, mileage, etc.), which help small operators keep an eye on operational costs​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. The main caveat is that MoveitPro expects you to adapt to its way of doing things; highly specific needs or unusual workflows are harder to accommodate (some users find the interface requires too many clicks for simple tasks and that adding custom items or handling edge cases can be challenging​
SUPERMOVE.COM
​
SUPERMOVE.COM
). Despite that, for most small movers it covers all the bases of running the business and is a proven solution in the industry.
6. Supermove
What it is: Supermove is a modern, cloud-based moving software that emphasizes configurability and ease of use. It’s a true all-in-one platform covering CRM, operations, and analytics – often praised for its intuitive interface and ongoing innovation in the moving software space​
SUPERMOVE.COM
​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Who it’s for: Supermove is geared toward movers that want cutting-edge technology and customization. It works for small companies but is priced as a premium solution (you’ll need to contact for a quote; it’s generally a larger investment that scales with your number of crews). If you value a highly flexible system and dedicated support partner, Supermove is an excellent fit. Key Features:
End-to-End Workflow Coverage: Supermove supports everything from lead generation to dispatch to invoicing on one platform​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. It has modules for local moves, interstate moves, storage, claims management, and more – meaning you won’t need separate tools for different types of jobs.
Highly Configurable Processes: A standout feature is its flexibility. You can configure custom workflows, pricing schemes, and documents. For example, you can customize how estimates are calculated or design your own bill of lading template and contracts​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. This allows the software to match your business processes rather than forcing you into a preset mold.
Automation & AI: Supermove leverages automation to reduce manual work. It can automate scheduling of follow-up tasks, send customers automatic text reminders (e.g., “Your crew is on the way” with GPS tracking link), and even use AI to help convert leads faster​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. The team frequently rolls out new features, keeping the software at the forefront of technology​
SUPERMOVE.COM
.
Mobile Crew App: Included is a robust mobile app (the “Crew App”) for your moving teams​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Crew members can conduct digital surveys of a home (even offline), access all required documents (no printing needed), collect signatures, and upload photos. (Currently the app is Android-only, iOS users can access the web version on mobile​
SUPERMOVE.COM
.)
Analytics and Reporting: Supermove offers deep reporting capabilities – you can analyze data across any timeframe and even get custom reports built for your needs​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. This helps in understanding business health (e.g. profitability per move, conversion rates, crew performance) and making data-driven decisions.
Problems it solves: Supermove’s core aim is to streamline and modernize moving operations that are often stuck with outdated or patchwork systems. For a small moving company, Supermove can dramatically reduce the time spent on administrative tasks by automating them – for instance, automatically sending customers updates and assigning tasks to staff so nothing is forgotten. It also greatly improves user experience: both your customers (through real-time notifications and an easy online process) and your employees (through an interface that’s easy to navigate and customize) benefit from a smoother experience​
SUPERMOVE.COM
​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. The dedicated support and training provided means even a small team can implement advanced features successfully – Supermove essentially “partners” with you to tailor the software to your business. The primary drawback is cost: it’s one of the more expensive solutions (reflecting its depth and support level)​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. However, for movers aiming to scale, the investment pays off by enabling efficiency and growth (many report high adoption rates and time savings that justify the cost). In short, Supermove’s differentiator is its configurability and cutting-edge automation, solving problems for small movers who want top-tier tech and are willing to invest in a scalable, long-term solution.
7. Elromco
What it is: Elromco is a cloud-based moving software with a strong focus on long-distance moving operations. It offers a wide array of features from CRM to dispatch, with an emphasis on planning complex trips. Elromco combines sales, operations, and even web marketing support into one system. Who it’s for: This platform serves both small startups and larger moving enterprises​
MOVERSDEV.COM
, but it’s especially useful for companies handling interstate or long-haul moves frequently. If you require detailed trip planning (routes, fuel, lodging) and also want help with things like your moving website and SEO, Elromco is a unique fit. Keep in mind it’s on the higher end of pricing (starting around $259/month on annual plans for unlimited users)​
MOVERSDEV.COM
. Key Features:
CRM & Lead Management: Elromco helps track potential clients from initial inquiry through booking​
MOVERSDEV.COM
. You can log leads, schedule in-home estimates, and convert them to jobs. It also features online booking capabilities – prospects can submit move requests or quote info via your website which flow into the software​
MOVERSDEV.COM
.
Estimating & Tariffs: The system supports creating moving estimates (for local and long-distance). However, a noted limitation is that its tariff support is somewhat manual – you may need to do custom calculations for certain long-distance pricing scenarios (weight-based pricing is not fully automated)​
SUPERMOVE.COM
.
Dispatching & Trip Planning: Elromco shines in dispatch and operations for long-distance moves. It allows you to plan trips with multiple legs, assign drivers, and manage logistics like weigh station stops or shuttles. Dispatchers can schedule crews and trucks with an overview of all ongoing trips to avoid conflicts. For local jobs, it has the standard crew scheduling as well.
Communication Tools: Internal and external communication is built in​
MOVERSDEV.COM
. Your team can communicate via the platform (notes, messages on jobs), and you can send emails or texts to customers. Customers also have a portal where they can see move details and updates (including GPS tracking of trucks on move day).
Document Management & Payments: Elromco generates Bills of Lading, estimates, and other paperwork in a professional format​
MOVERSDEV.COM
. It also handles payment processing so customers can pay deposits or balances online. Additionally, Elromco offers to help with your website and SEO as part of its service package (an unusual feature), helping attract leads in the first place​
SUPERMOVE.COM
.
Problems it solves: For small moving businesses that venture into long-distance jobs, Elromco addresses the challenge of complex move planning. It provides tools to map out long-distance moves more thoroughly than many standard moving CRMs – ensuring you don’t miss critical trip details and can give accurate quotes. Its comprehensive approach means you’re not using separate tools for CRM, dispatch, and communications; everything is integrated, which reduces errors (e.g., dispatch knows the exact terms promised in the sales process). Elromco also improves customer transparency: clients can see their move details and get updates, which builds trust. On the flip side, the sophistication comes with a learning curve during setup, and the software may feel less friendly on mobile devices (some users report it’s harder to use on a phone)​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Also, if your business relies heavily on tariff-based pricing, you might need to do extra work as the system’s automation there is limited​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Overall, Elromco solves the problem of managing detailed operations for interstate moves and provides strong support (each client gets a dedicated account manager and solid phone/email support) to help small movers succeed in long-distance moving.
8. CompuMove
What it is: CompuMove is an established moving company software (dating back to 1984) that offers a highly integrated system covering sales, dispatch, and accounting. It’s a feature-rich platform that can be deployed on-premises or cloud, known for handling everything from move estimates to financials in one package​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Who it’s for: CompuMove is best for medium to large moving operations or smaller companies that are very process-heavy. It’s used by multi-branch movers and those with storage or specialized services​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. A small residential mover can use CompuMove, but be prepared for a more complex system (and you’ll need to contact the company for pricing, as it’s customized)​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. Key Features:
Integrated CRM & Operations: CompuMove merges sales lead management, booking, dispatch, and billing seamlessly​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. When a lead is booked, it transitions into the operations module without re-entry. It supports local, intrastate, interstate, and international move workflows, each with proper documentation (e.g., it can produce tariff forms, customs docs, etc.).
Dispatch and Capacity Planning: The dispatch board allows assignment of crews and equipment to jobs, and it includes rating and tariff calculations (especially for agent-based or van line moves). It can print orders, labels, and any forms needed for the crew​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. You can manage multiple jobs and trucks concurrently and track their progress.
Accounting & Financial Reporting: A distinguishing feature is the built-in accounting. CompuMove handles your accounts receivable, payable, payroll, and generates financial reports tailored to moving (like revenue breakdown by driver or job type)​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. This eliminates the need for a separate accounting software, though it can export data to QuickBooks if required.
Customizable Job System: The software offers a flexible Job System which means it can be custom-fitted to unique needs​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. Many aspects (forms, reports) can be customized by the CompuMove team during setup to fit how your business operates.
Deployment Options & Support: CompuMove can be run on your own server or accessed via the web in a cloud setup. There are mobile-friendly components (e.g., a driver app for inventory and paperwork capture)​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Support is provided via email/phone, but note that as a small company, their update cycle is slower and support requests can sometimes take a while​
SUPERMOVE.COM
​
SUPERMOVE.COM
.
Problems it solves: CompuMove is like the “old guard” solution that tackles all operational problems in one system – particularly the challenge of linking operations with accounting. For small movers that plan to grow, it can handle complexity: you won’t outgrow the software as you add services or branches. It’s very thorough in compliance (tariffs, regulation forms) and ensures financial accuracy by integrating billing with bookkeeping. Many small businesses struggle with separate systems for quotes, job management, and accounting – CompuMove solves that by unifying them, reducing data entry errors and ensuring that every job’s costs and revenues are tracked to the penny. However, the trade-off is user experience: the interface is known to be dated and not very intuitive​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. New users often face a steep learning curve and might require significant training to use it efficiently. If you’re a tiny operation, CompuMove might feel like using a cannon to kill a fly – powerful but heavy. On the other hand, if you anticipate growth or need strong accounting integration now, CompuMove’s all-in-one approach can be a long-term asset (just be prepared for its slower pace of updates and the possibility of needing support for complex setups).
9. eMover Software
What it is: eMover is a cloud-based moving & storage software that offers modules for CRM, dispatch, long-distance moves, and even phone call integration​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. It’s a newer entrant that provides an affordable yet broad solution for moving companies. Who it’s for: eMover is suited for small and mid-size moving companies, including those that do a mix of local and international moves. It’s especially attractive to movers on a budget who still want advanced features – with plans starting around $114/month​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
, it’s priced moderately. Key Features:
CRM Module: eMover’s CRM helps log inquiries, track follow-ups, and manage customer contacts​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. It keeps a history of communications and has basic sales automation (like setting reminders to follow up on estimates).
Dispatch Module: The dispatch module allows for scheduling local moves with trucks and crew assignments. It provides a calendar and job timeline view. For long-distance jobs, there are specific features (like an International module) that account for things like container shipments or coordinating with partner agents​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
.
Integrated Phone System: A standout feature is phone system integration​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. eMover can integrate with VoIP phone systems so that when a client calls, their information pops up, and calls can be logged under their record. This is great for sales and customer service tracking, ensuring all calls are documented.
Quotes and Invoicing: You can create estimates and email them to clients, convert approved quotes to jobs, and later invoice the customers. eMover supports both local hourly rates and long-distance weight/cube-based estimates. It can generate Bills of Lading and inventory lists. All documents are stored online for access from any device.
Reporting & Cloud Access: eMover includes reporting tools for sales (leads, bookings, revenue) and operations (completed moves, crew productivity). Because it’s entirely cloud-based, you access it through a web browser on any device – there’s no software to install, and updates are automatic​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. Data is centralized, so your team (from office staff to field crew with tablets) can all use the system simultaneously.
Problems it solves: Small moving companies often struggle to find a single software that covers local and international moves – eMover addresses this by having dedicated modules for different move types in one platform​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. It improves communication by integrating with phone calls: this means when a repeat customer calls, you immediately see their past move history and notes, which enhances customer service. It also ensures you never lose track of phone leads. By being cloud-based and device-agnostic, eMover gives a small company flexibility to work from anywhere (office, home, on-site estimates). The affordable pricing solves the problem of high upfront software costs; you can start without a huge investment. Being newer, some features might not be as deep as older competitors (for example, the UI is modern but the range of integrations might be more limited than bigger platforms). Nonetheless, eMover’s all-in-one approach – CRM + dispatch + specialty modules + phone integration – helps a small mover run daily operations efficiently and present a professional, tech-forward face to customers without breaking the bank.
10. Vonigo
What it is: Vonigo is a field service management platform that offers a configurable suite of modules for service businesses, including moving companies. It’s essentially a business management software with capabilities for CRM, online booking, scheduling, dispatching, and invoicing – which can be tailored to moving services​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. Who it’s for: Vonigo is best for small to mid-sized movers who may also offer other services or want a highly configurable, user-based pricing model. If you run a moving company that values online booking for customers and might expand into related services (deliveries, junk removal, etc.), Vonigo’s flexibility is appealing. It is sold on a per-user subscription (around $98 per user/month for the starter plan)​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. Key Features:
Online Booking & Website Integration: Vonigo enables moving companies to offer online booking to clients​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. You can embed a booking widget on your website where customers specify their move details, choose available time slots, and even get pricing. This can increase lead capture and conversion by simplifying how customers schedule moves.
Scheduling & Dispatching: It provides drag-and-drop scheduling of jobs and a dispatch dashboard to monitor jobs in progress. Crew routing and route planning are included to optimize travel time between jobs​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. The system can send automatic notifications to customers about their scheduled move and to crews about assigned jobs.
Work Orders & Invoicing: For each move (work order), Vonigo handles the details – inventory of items isn’t its strong suit (it’s more generalized, so it may not have a detailed moving inventory list)​
G2.COM
, but you can describe job requirements. After service, you can generate invoices and take payments through the platform. It also supports managing claims and follow-up tasks if any issues arise during a move​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
.
Reporting & Integrations: Vonigo includes reporting tools to track sales, jobs completed, revenue, and other metrics. It integrates with QuickBooks for accounting and can connect to other apps via Zapier or API. Additionally, it has modules for other business aspects (like CRM for follow-up marketing or managing a fleet of vehicles).
Multi-Location Support: If a moving business has multiple locations or franchises, Vonigo is equipped to handle that structure, with configuration options for each branch’s scheduling and pricing. It’s cloud-based, so everyone accesses it online, and the interface is fairly modern.
Problems it solves: Vonigo addresses the need for service delivery optimization in a moving business​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. For small moving companies, one immediate benefit is the professional online booking experience – you can capture leads 24/7 without phone tag, which is a big convenience for customers. It also reduces scheduling errors by centralizing the calendar and providing real-time updates to both customers and staff. Because Vonigo is not exclusively for movers, it’s very configurable: it can bend to different pricing models or services, which solves the problem of being locked into one way of operating. For example, if you charge differently for packing services or have unique add-ons, you can configure those options. On the other hand, this generality is also Vonigo’s weakness for pure moving needs – some moving-specific functions (like detailed inventory management or automated long-distance tariff calculations) are not as developed compared to moving-only software​
G2.COM
. A moving company might have to create workarounds for those (e.g., attach an inventory spreadsheet). Also, because it’s per-user pricing, costs can add up as your team grows, which a very small mover must consider. In summary, Vonigo’s notable strength is providing a slick, customer-friendly booking and scheduling system that can make a small moving company look and operate like a tech-savvy operation, while its trade-offs include a learning curve to configure it to your needs and some missing niche moving features.

Notable Differentiators and Choosing the Right CRM
All these platforms can dramatically improve a small moving company’s operations, but their strengths differ. Here are some key differentiators to help you evaluate which CRM aligns best with your business needs:
Ease of Use vs. Depth: If you need something simple and quick to deploy, look at options like MoversTech or MoverBase. These prioritize user-friendly design and have the core features to get you up and running immediately. In contrast, Movegistics or CompuMove offer deeper functionality (covering every nuance of moving), but they require more training and effort to master. Consider how tech-savvy your team is – a slightly simpler tool that everyone actually uses may beat a complex one with unused features.
Automation & Advanced Tools: For movers focused on automation and cutting-edge features, Supermove stands out. It leads in AI-driven workflows and custom configurability​
SUPERMOVE.COM
, essentially acting as a tech partner to continually optimize your business. Movegistics also offers marketing automation (like drip email campaigns) and a customer portal which can set you apart in customer service. If your goal is to automate as much as possible – from lead follow-ups to task reminders – these platforms provide that edge.
Pricing & Scalability: MoverBase is unrivaled for budget-conscious startups – its $10/month basic plan is a low-risk way to go digital​
VERIFIEDMOVERS.COM
. MoversTech too offers a lot for a moderate flat fee. On the other hand, some solutions like Vonigo (per user pricing) or Supermove (premium plans) can become costly for larger teams, but they bring more expansive capabilities. Think about your 5-year growth plan: investing in a scalable solution like Supermove or Elromco now might save you from switching later if you expect to expand to multiple crews or locations, whereas a leaner solution might suffice if you intend to remain a small operation.
Specialization in Moving: While all listed software can handle moving, Vonigo is more generalist (serving many field-service industries) – which means a slick interface but possibly requiring adaptation for moving specifics​
G2.COM
. In contrast, SmartMoving, MoveitPro, Movegistics, etc., were built by movers for movers, so they come with industry best practices baked in (like built-in moving estimates, BOL forms, tariff support). If you want something that “just works” for moving out-of-the-box, a moving-specialized CRM is likely a better fit. For example, SmartMoving or MoveitPro will align closely with typical moving company workflows from day one, whereas with Vonigo you might spend more time customizing it to match moving terminology and processes.
Mobile and Field Operation Support: If your crew’s adoption is key (i.e., you want your foremen using an app on moving day), look at options with a strong mobile app or portal. Supermove provides a comprehensive crew mobile app experience (digital inventories, signatures, photos)​
SUPERMOVE.COM
. Movegistics and MoveitPro also have mobile-friendly solutions for crews. A happy crew using the software means real-time updates and less paperwork returning to the office. Some products like CompuMove or Elromco are more dispatcher/office oriented (with limited dedicated mobile features), which could be fine if you just need office staff coordination. So, weigh how important on-site mobile functionality is for your business.
Customer Experience: In the moving industry, referrals and reviews matter. Software that helps you deliver a better customer experience can indirectly drive business. Supermove’s automated customer updates, Vonigo’s online booking, and Movegistics’ customer portal all shine here. If you want to impress tech-savvy customers, these features are differentiators – for instance, letting a customer book a move online and track the truck like an Uber can set you apart from competitors. On the flip side, if your clientele prefers the personal touch of phone estimates and you get business through word-of-mouth, you might prioritize operational efficiency over flashy customer-facing tech.
In conclusion, the “best” CRM for a small residential moving company is the one that fits your unique mix of budget, technical ability, and business focus. For a tight budget and simplicity, MoverBase might be the top choice. For aggressive growth and automation, Supermove or Movegistics could deliver the most value. For a balanced, moving-specific all-rounder, solutions like SmartMoving, MoveitPro, or MoversTech provide strong foundations. Evaluate the pros and cons above in light of your operations – perhaps even take advantage of free trials or demos – to see which platform feels like a natural extension of your business. With the right CRM in place, even a small moving company can punch above its weight class in efficiency, customer service, and profitability, setting the stage for long-term success in the moving industry.
